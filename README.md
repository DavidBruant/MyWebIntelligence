MyWebIntelligence
=================
The opensource platform MyWebIntelligence (or MyWi,) produced by the MICA laboratory as part of the Institute of Digital Humanities is to provide a strategic tool in the analysis and understanding of communication on the Internet. This is a "crawler" of a new generation which, from a keyword dictionary, buid a database of qualified web pages in the service of strategic intelligence. It not only utilizes numerous external data sources but the latest data classification algorithms (ANS TextAnalysis, etc.)

My Web Intelligence can provide the means to capture, qualify and prioritize considerable discourse mass to map the universe of discourse on your interests. This will not only have real-time studies in the online discourse but also better understand the heterogeneous actors by their arguments and strategies.
